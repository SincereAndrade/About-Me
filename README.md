## Summary

Hello world! My name is Sincere Andrade. I am a senior attending Brockton High School. I have lived in Brockton my entire life and have yet to travel outside of the United States of America. I am 17 years old and I have a job working as a bua boy for a resteraunt. I enjoy playing videogames whenever I can find the time to play. My favorite series of video games is pokemon(Except Sun and Moon and its sequels) and have plsyed every generation at some point in my life(besides gen 1).

I contracted into the Navy during the summer of 2019 and I will ship out July 9th,2020. I have one pet, which is a cat. I am not that good at math but I tend to soak in information. 

## Family

My family is pretty extensive and to be completely honest, I haven't met everybody on both sides of my family yet. I live with my mom and my two sisters. My siblings are younger than me and tend to annoy me.

My dads side is a completely different story. I have yet to meet the family of mine that live in Cape Verde. My grandfather has many kids and many, many grandchildren.
